## SEC335 Target Generation Overview

### Summary
***
This project involved myself and my Capstone team assisting one of our professors, Devin Paden in developing and deploying targets for students to attack in the SEC335 Ethical Hacking course offered by Champlian College. The goal was to turn the class into one where labs were operated similiarly to a Hack the Box/CTF format in order to facilitate a more relaisitc attack scenario. Alongside this we also would update the vulnerbailities to be more relevant to what can be found in the wild as well as automated the deployment using Ansible to reduce overhead and to allow mass deployment over the SEC335 Vsphere environment.
